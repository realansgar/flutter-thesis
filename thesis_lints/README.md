# Flutter thesis lints

This repo contains lint rules that detect API usages and 3 dangerous code patterns in Flutter Android apps. Generic lint rule classes are used to detect method calls or constructor invocations. The full list of lint rules is in the `thesis_lints.dart` file. To use these lint rules, the `custom_lint` package is required.
